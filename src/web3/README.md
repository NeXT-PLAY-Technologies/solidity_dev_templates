# Web3 Interactions

This directory contains scripts and utilities for interacting with the blockchain using Web3.js. It provides functions to connect to Ethereum nodes, interact with smart contracts, and handle transactions.

## Structure

- **Connection**: Establish a connection to an Ethereum node using Web3.js.
- **Contract Interaction**: Load and interact with deployed smart contracts.
- **Transaction Handling**: Send and manage transactions on the blockchain.

## Examples

- Connecting to a node: `web3.eth.connect()`
- Interacting with a contract: `contract.methods.myMethod().call()`

## Best Practices

- Always handle errors and exceptions.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information like private keys.
