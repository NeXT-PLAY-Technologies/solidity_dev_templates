# Token Factory Templates

This directory contains advanced templates for creating token factories that can deploy tokens based on multiple ERC standards. These factories allow for the creation of single or hybrid tokens that comply with widely adopted ERC standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) while ensuring compatibility with traditional financial systems through ISO standards.

## Supported ERC Standards

### ERC-20: Fungible Token Standard
This template creates ERC-20 tokens, the most widely used standard for fungible tokens. Features like minting, burning, and pausing can be optionally included.

### ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard
This template generates ERC-721 tokens, enabling the creation of unique, indivisible assets like NFTs. Metadata and ownership transfers are supported.

### ERC-1155: Multi-Token Standard
ERC-1155 templates allow the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract. This is ideal for gaming, collectibles, or tokenized assets that require flexible token management.

### ERC-2535: Diamond Standard
The Diamond Standard template creates upgradeable, modular contracts where new features can be added as **facets**. This enables flexibility in governance, treasury management, and cross-chain interoperability.

## ISO Standards for Financial and Identity Systems

These token factories ensure interoperability with traditional financial systems by embedding ISO-compliant structures into the contracts.

### ISO 20022: Financial Messaging
This standard provides a messaging framework for integrating token transactions with financial systems like SEPA and SWIFT, ensuring compatibility for fiat transfers.

### ISO 4217: Currency Codes
The template supports tokenized fiat currencies that adhere to ISO 4217 currency codes (e.g., USD, EUR), allowing seamless exchange between tokenized fiat and traditional currencies.

### ISO 8583: Payment Processing
Templates include support for converting blockchain transactions into ISO 8583 messages, enabling integration with credit card payment systems and processors.

### ISO 13616: IBAN
IBAN-compatible tokens can be transferred to bank accounts across borders, allowing seamless fiat withdrawals from tokenized assets.

### ISO 29115: Decentralized Identity (DID) and KYC Compliance
Ensure that token holders meet regulatory KYC requirements using ISO 29115-compliant identity verification, providing higher assurance levels for security tokens and financial transactions.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-standard Token Factory**: Deploy ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 tokens, or hybrid tokens that combine multiple standards in a single deployment.
2. **ISO-compliant Messaging**: Interoperate with financial systems via ISO 20022, ISO 8583, and SWIFT for seamless fiat integration.
3. **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Use the Diamond Standard (ERC-2535) for cross-chain governance and asset transfers.
4.  **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Use the Diamond Standard (ERC-2535) to enable cross-chain governance and asset transfers, allowing tokens to operate across multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon). This ensures seamless token movement and governance actions across various networks, with the potential to interact with traditional financial infrastructure through ISO standards.
5.  **Layer 2 Scaling Support**: Templates are designed to deploy tokens on Layer 2 scaling solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum), reducing transaction costs and improving transaction speed. This is especially useful for applications requiring high throughput or microtransactions.
6.  **Decentralized Identity (DID) Integration**: The token factory supports DID frameworks and KYC compliance using ISO 29115. This ensures that only verified entities can mint or own specific types of tokens, such as security tokens or financial derivatives.
7.  **Compliance Reporting**: Automatically generate ISO 15022-compliant reports for tokenized securities transactions, ensuring that trades and transfers are reported to regulators and exchanges in real-time. This helps with compliance in regulated markets.
8.  **Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The Diamond Standard facets support granular access control via RBAC. Different roles can be assigned, such as administrator, token holder, and treasury manager, to restrict access to certain functions (e.g., minting, burning, governance voting).

## Example Usage
-------------

The token factory templates allow you to deploy tokens with customizable features, all while maintaining interoperability with both blockchain and fiat financial systems. Here's an example of creating a hybrid token that combines ERC-20 (fungible) and ERC-721 (non-fungible) standards, with governance via the Diamond Standard:

```solidity
contract HybridTokenFactory {
    function createHybridToken(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        bool mintable,
        bool burnable,
        bool isERC721
    ) external returns (address) {
        // Logic for deploying either ERC-20, ERC-721, or hybrid tokens
    }
}
```

This example showcases how a single factory can deploy different token types, either based on a single ERC standard or a combination of standards. You can also extend these tokens with additional features such as ISO-compliant messaging, fiat integration, and cross-chain compatibility.

Conclusion
----------

These token factory templates provide a robust, modular framework for creating tokens that comply with multiple ERC standards while integrating with traditional financial systems via ISO standards. Whether youâ€™re issuing fungible tokens, NFTs, or multi-token contracts, these templates ensure your tokens can seamlessly operate across blockchain networks and fiat infrastructure.

For detailed instructions on using these templates, please refer to the accompanying documentation or explore the provided example contracts.
