# Gas Optimization Tests

This directory contains tests and scripts for optimizing gas usage in smart contracts. These tests help identify areas where gas consumption can be reduced.

## Importance

- Reducing gas costs makes transactions more affordable for users.
- Optimized contracts are more efficient and scalable.

## Techniques

- Use `view` and `pure` functions where possible.
- Minimize storage operations.
- Use efficient data structures.

## Running Tests

- Analyze gas usage: `truffle test --show-gas`
- Optimize functions and re-test.
