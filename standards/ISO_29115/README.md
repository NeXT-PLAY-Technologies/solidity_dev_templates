# ISO 29115

ISO 29115 provides a framework for entity authentication assurance. It defines four levels of assurance (LoA) for the authentication of entities in online transactions. The standard outlines the requirements for each level, including identity proofing, credential management, and authentication mechanisms.

## Levels of Assurance

- **LoA 1**: Little or no confidence in the asserted identity.
- **LoA 2**: Some confidence in the asserted identity.
- **LoA 3**: High confidence in the asserted identity.
- **LoA 4**: Very high confidence in the asserted identity.

## Implementation

- Conduct identity proofing and verification.
- Implement secure credential management.
- Use strong authentication mechanisms.

## Benefits

- Improved security and trust in online transactions.
- Compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Enhanced user experience and satisfaction.
