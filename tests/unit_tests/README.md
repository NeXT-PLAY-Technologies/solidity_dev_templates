# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the smart contracts and scripts. Unit tests are designed to test individual components in isolation to ensure they function as expected.

## Writing Tests

- Use the Mocha framework for JavaScript tests.
- Write tests for each function in the smart contracts.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit under test.

## Running Tests

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run tests: `npm test`

## Examples

- Test a contract function: `it('should return the correct value', async () => { ... })`
