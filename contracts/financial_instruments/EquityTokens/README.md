# Equity Tokens

Equity tokens represent ownership in a company or asset, similar to traditional shares. They are tokenized on the blockchain to provide transparency, liquidity, and ease of transfer.

## Use Case

Equity tokens can be used to raise capital, distribute dividends, and provide voting rights to token holders. They are subject to regulatory compliance and must adhere to securities laws.

## Tokenization

This project tokenizes equity by creating smart contracts that represent shares in a company. Each token is backed by a legal agreement and is compliant with relevant regulations.

## Legal Considerations

- Ensure compliance with securities regulations.
- Provide clear terms and conditions for token holders.
